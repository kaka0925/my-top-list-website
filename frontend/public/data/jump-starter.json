    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "1. Peak Amperage",
        "content": "Peak amperage determines what size engine you can jump start. For most passenger vehicles (4-6 cylinder gas engines), 1000-2000A is sufficient. Larger vehicles like trucks and SUVs with V8 engines or diesel engines need 2500A or more. Heavy-duty vehicles may require 4000A+."
      },
      {
        "title": "2. Battery Capacity",
        "content": "Measured in mAh (milliamp hours), this determines how many jump starts you can perform per charge. A 10000mAh battery typically provides 15-20 jumps, while 20000mAh+ units can deliver 30+ jumps. Higher capacity also means longer standby time between charges."
      },
      {
        "title": "3. Built-in Air Compressor",
        "content": "An integrated air compressor adds tremendous value for roadside emergencies. Look for models with at least 120-150PSI capability that can inflate a standard tire in 3-5 minutes. This eliminates the need to carry a separate inflator."
      },
      {
        "title": "4. Fast Charging Technology",
        "content": "Modern jump starters with USB-C Power Delivery (45W-100W) can recharge in 1-3 hours versus 8-12 hours for older models. This is crucial if you forget to charge it regularly. Fast charging also allows the unit to serve as a laptop power bank."
      },
      {
        "title": "5. Safety Features",
        "content": "Essential safety protections include reverse polarity protection (prevents damage from incorrect connections), spark-proof technology, over-current protection, and over-temperature shutoff. Premium models like NOCO use advanced \"UltraSafe\" systems that make them nearly foolproof."
      },
      {
        "title": "Our Best Picks",
        "content": "Best Overall: WOLFBOX 4000A - Combines powerful output, large battery, built-in compressor, and fast charging at a competitive price. Best Budget: WOLFBOX 3000A - Excellent performance and 65W fast charging at under $90. Best Premium: NOCO Boost Plus GB40 - Industry-leading UltraSafe technology and brand reliability."

  },
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How often should I charge my jump starter?",
      "answer": "Charge your jump starter every 3-6 months even if unused. Modern lithium jump starters hold charge well, but regular top-ups ensure they're ready when needed. Check the LED indicator monthly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use a jump starter on diesel engines?",
      "answer": "Yes, but diesel engines require higher amperage than gas engines. Use at least 2500A for small diesels (under 4L) and 4000A+ for larger diesel trucks. Always check the manufacturer's specifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to leave a jump starter in my car?",
      "answer": "Avoid leaving jump starters in extreme temperatures (below 32°F or above 104°F) as this degrades the lithium battery. Store in a temperature-controlled location when possible, or bring it inside during extreme weather."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need an air compressor built-in?",
      "answer": "While not essential, an integrated air compressor is highly convenient for roadside emergencies. It eliminates carrying a separate inflator and ensures you can handle both dead batteries and flat tires with one device."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between peak amps and cranking amps?",
      "answer": "Peak amps is the maximum current for 1-3 seconds during initial cranking. Cranking amps (CA) is sustained output for 30 seconds. Peak amps is the more commonly advertised spec. A 3000A peak unit typically provides 500-600 cranking amps."
